- Many test series today simply **copy UPSC Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** without adding real value.
- Some institutes and websites even **lift questions from chatbots** like ChatGPT or Perplexity.
- The result? **Irrelevant, poorly framed, or out-of-context questions** that don't match the UPSC pattern.

This lack of **transparency in question selection** puts serious aspirants at a disadvantage, wasting their time and energy.
