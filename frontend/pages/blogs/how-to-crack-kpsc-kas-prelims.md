- ## What Is the Most Important Resource for Cracking Any Competitive Exam?
  
  An ideal aspirant knows what is important to crack any exam: it is **Previous Year Papers**. However, many candidates neglect this crucial resource and directly choose mock tests, which are too fact-focused and don't provide strategic insights into the actual examination pattern.  
- ## How Did I Transition from UPSC CSE to KPSC KAS Preparation?
  
  When I switched from UPSC CSE to KPSC KAS preparation, I just focused on solving other KPSC Group A, B, and C services PYQs to understand the psychology of paper setters. This strategic approach helped me decode the examination pattern and identify what paper setters actually look for in answers.  
- ## What Was My First Step Before Analyzing Previous Year Papers?
  
  Before analyzing PYQs, I filled my information gap by making notes of Karnataka History and Geography. This foundational step was essential because without basic subject knowledge, it's impossible to recognize patterns or understand what the exam actually demands from candidates.  
- ## How Did I Identify What Information Actually Needs to Be Studied?
  
  After revising my Karnataka History and Geography notes along with PYQs for many days, I came to understand what information actually needs to be studied. Through continuous revision and practice, I identified the exact depth of knowledge required and which topics appear repeatedly in examinations.  
- ## How Did I Create One-Sheet Notes for Karnataka Geography?
  
  I made a short, just one-sheet of notes full of mnemonics and mental maps for Karnataka Geography. This condensed format included:  
	- Mnemonic devices for quick recall
