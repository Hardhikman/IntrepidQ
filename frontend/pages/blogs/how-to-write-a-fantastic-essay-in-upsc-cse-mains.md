# How to Write a Fantastic Essay in UPSC CSE Mains

Writing a good essay in the UPSC Civil Services Mains examination is crucial for scoring well in the optional papers. Here are some tips and strategies to help you write excellent essays.

- ### How should an essay be planned?
	Start by brainstorming three things: how to begin the introduction, what to say in the body, and how to end the essay well. This keeps ideas focused and linked from start to finish.
	- Write the hook and thesis for the introduction.
	- List key points, examples, and data for the body.
	- Decide the main takeaway and a closing line for the conclusion.
- ### How to structure a paragraph?
  Use a five-step flow: introduce the idea, explain it, give an example or data, add a contrast, and end with a short conclusion in 3–5 sentences.
	- Template: Introduce → Explain → Example/Data → Contrast → Mini‑conclusion.
	- Do not stretch a paragraph beyond five sentences; split when a new sub-idea starts.
- ### Why are connectors important?
  Connectors show how ideas are related and help to move from one paragraph to another smoothly. They also make the logic clear for the reader.
	- Use connectors to start a new paragraph when the argument shifts.
	- Place them near the start of sentences to guide the reader.
- ### How to write the introduction?
  Open with a hook, then link to a clear thesis, and preview the body’s main points. Keep it short and purposeful.
	- Preferred method: a short fictional story that leads to the thesis and connects parts in order.
	- Other methods: history, context, current affairs, or a main idea from a non‑fiction book.
- ### What matters in the body?
  Focus on content, flow, grammar, and tone—in that order. This makes the essay rich, clear, correct, and analytical.
	- Content: ideas close to the topic, broad keywords, and strong examples.
	- Flow: use pronouns, demonstratives, and connectors for coherence.
	- Grammar: keep verb tenses and spellings correct.
	- Tone: be analytical; weigh reasons and effects, not just narration.
- ### Which pronouns and demonstratives help flow?
  Use short referring words to avoid repetition and keep links clear. Make sure their reference is obvious.
	- Pronouns: he, she, it, they.
	- Demonstratives: this, these, that, those.
- ### Which connectors should be used?
  Pick connectors based on the logic needed: addition, sequence, contrast, or cause–effect. Keep them varied, not repetitive.
	- Addition: moreover, also, in addition.
	- Sequence: before this, firstly, then, next.
	- Contrast: but, however, yet.
	- Cause–effect: therefore, thus, so, consequently.
- ### How to keep paragraphs concise?
  Limit to a maximum of five sentences so each paragraph carries one clear micro-argument. Break when a new point begins.
	- Use a connector to open the next paragraph and keep continuity.
- ### How to keep an analytical tone?
  Make a claim, give a reason, add evidence, note a counterpoint, and end with an inference. This shows judgment, not just facts.
	- Mini-structure: claim → reason → evidence → contrast → inference.
- ### How to write the conclusion?
  Summarize the key points, restate the thesis in light of the body, and close with a strong final line. A quote can be used if it fits the topic.
	- Avoid adding new arguments; focus on synthesis and closure.
- ### Sample paragraph (five-step pattern)
   “Public policy improves when feedback is quick. This matters because delays hide errors. For example, monthly service dashboards allow timely fixes. However, annual reviews can lock in waste. Therefore, build systems with short feedback loops for better outcomes.”
- ### Value additions
	- #### Quick templates
		- Introduction: “Hook … Context … Thesis … Roadmap (Point A, Point B, Point C) …”
		- Paragraph: “Claim … Because … Evidence … However … Therefore …”
		- Conclusion: “Synthesize (A+B+C) … Reframe thesis … Implication/Quote …”
	- #### Connector and pronoun table
	  
	  | Type | Use words |
	  | :-- | :-- |
	  | Addition | moreover, also, in addition |
	  | Sequence | before this, firstly, then, next, finally |
	  | Contrast | but, however, yet, on the other hand |
	  | Cause–effect | therefore, thus, so, consequently |
	  | Pronouns | he, she, it, they |
	  | Demonstratives | this, these, that, those |
	- #### 10‑point self‑check
		- Clear hook and thesis in the introduction.
		- Paragraphs follow the five-step pattern.
		- Each paragraph stays within 3–5 sentences.
		- Strong, relevant examples or data.
		- Contrast or counter‑point included.
		- Connectors used clearly and varied.
		- Pronouns and demonstratives have clear references.
		- Verb tenses and spellings are correct.
		- Tone is analytical, not just descriptive.
		- Conclusion synthesizes and resonates, with an optional quote.
	- #### Short FAQ
		- Can a story start an essay? Yes—keep it brief and link it to the thesis within three sentences.
		- How many sentences per paragraph? Usually 3–5; start a new one when a new point begins.
		- Which connectors improve analysis? Contrast and cause–effect show thinking better than only sequence.
		- What makes a strong conclusion? Synthesis of key points, a refreshed thesis, and a clear final line.
- ### One‑sentence takeaway
  Essays become clear and compelling when each paragraph follows introduce → explain → evidence → contrast → conclude within 3–5 sentences, guided by precise connectors and an analytical tone from hook to closing line.

- ### Examples using intrepidq ai format
	- #### Example 1: Essay Topic — "Technology and Social Change"
		- ##### Introduction (with fictional story hook)
		  
		  A farmer in rural Maharashtra once walked five kilometers to pay his electricity bill. Today, he does it from his phone in seconds. This transformation illustrates how technology reshapes daily life and social structures. Technology acts as a catalyst for social change by democratizing access, accelerating communication, and challenging traditional hierarchies. This essay examines how digital tools drive inclusion, the tensions they create, and the path toward equitable progress.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 1 (five-step pattern)
		  
		  **Digital platforms democratize access to information and services across social strata.** This matters because historically, geography and class determined who could learn, transact, or participate. For example, UPI transactions grew from 1 billion to over 10 billion monthly within five years, reaching tier-3 towns and villages. However, the digital divide persists—only 38% of rural households have internet access according to NFHS-5 data. Therefore, technology enables inclusion when paired with infrastructure and digital literacy programs.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 2 (five-step pattern with contrast)
		  
		  **Social media accelerates collective action but also fragments public discourse.** Citizens can mobilize quickly for causes like environmental justice or gender rights using platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp. For instance, the #MeToo movement in India empowered thousands to share experiences and demand accountability. Yet, these same tools amplify misinformation and deepen echo chambers, polarizing communities. Consequently, technology's social impact depends on governance frameworks that balance free expression with accountability.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 3 (analytical tone with multi-dimensional view)
		  
		  **Automation challenges traditional employment while creating new economic opportunities.** The gig economy, powered by apps like Swiggy and Urban Company, offers flexible income but lacks social security. Moreover, AI threatens routine jobs in banking and manufacturing, affecting 69% of India's workforce per NITI Aayog estimates. However, sectors like data annotation, content moderation, and digital services absorb displaced workers when reskilling is accessible. Thus, the transition requires active labor policy—not passive adaptation.
		- ##### Conclusion (synthesis + forward-looking phrase)
		  
		  Technology drives social change by expanding access, enabling voices, and reshaping work—yet it also risks deepening inequality and fragmentation. Therefore, the path forward demands inclusive digital infrastructure, robust data governance, and adaptive skill ecosystems. A citizen-centric approach that measures outcomes in dignity, opportunity, and equity will ensure technology becomes a tool for democratic change, not division. As Amartya Sen reminds us, development is freedom—and technology must serve that freedom for all.

	- #### Example 2: Essay Topic — "Federalism and Development"
		- ##### Introduction (contextual hook)
		  
		  India's Constitution distributes powers between the Union and States through a federal structure designed to balance unity with diversity. However, after seven decades, tensions over GST revenue, concurrent list subjects, and centralized schemes reveal strains in this arrangement. Federalism is not just a legal framework—it is a living process that shapes how development reaches citizens. This essay explores the constitutional design, emerging challenges, and reforms needed for cooperative federalism to deliver equitable growth.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 1 (five-step with data)
		  
		  **The Seventh Schedule allocates subjects across Union, State, and Concurrent Lists to enable specialization.** This division allows the Centre to handle defense and foreign policy while States manage agriculture, police, and local health. For example, the National Health Mission operates through state governments, respecting local capacity and priorities. However, Article 356 and frequent use of Governor's discretion have centralized power in practice, undermining state autonomy. Therefore, federalism works best when constitutional checks prevent overreach and fiscal transfers reflect state needs.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 2 (contrast and evidence)
		  
		  **Centralized schemes like PM-KISAN provide uniformity but reduce state flexibility in addressing local needs.** While direct benefit transfers reach 11 crore farmers quickly, they bypass state-specific crop patterns and irrigation challenges. In contrast, decentralized models like Kerala's Kudumbashree empower local bodies to design poverty programs suited to their context, achieving better outcomes. Thus, one-size-fits-all approaches sacrifice customization for speed, whereas federalism's strength lies in tailoring solutions to regional realities.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 3 (multi-dimensional + action word)
		  
		  **GST revenue-sharing disputes highlight the need to institutionalize fiscal federalism through transparent formulas.** The 15th Finance Commission increased the states' share to 41%, yet cess and surcharges—outside the divisible pool—rose sharply, reducing effective devolution. Moreover, compensation cess delays during COVID-19 strained state finances, forcing cuts in health and education spending. Hence, federalize revenue mechanisms by bringing all taxes into the divisible pool and automate transfers via a dashboard for accountability.
		- ##### Conclusion (synthesis + Preamble anchor)
		  
		  Federalism must evolve from a legal distribution of power to a partnership model where the Centre enables and states innovate. Transparent fiscal transfers, reduced central overreach, and empowered local bodies will unlock India's diversity as a development asset. This roadmap is equitable, reaching last-mile communities while respecting constitutional morality. It advances justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity in spirit—ensuring that federalism becomes a catalyst for prosperity, not paralysis.

	- #### Example 3: Essay Topic — "Ethics in Public Administration"
		- ##### Introduction (current affairs hook)
		  
		  Recent cases of exam paper leaks and bribery in recruitment have shaken public trust in administrative systems. Ethics in public administration is not an abstract ideal—it determines whether citizens receive fair treatment, whether merit is rewarded, and whether the state functions with integrity. This essay examines the foundations of administrative ethics, systemic challenges, and measures to institutionalize accountability and transparency in governance.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 1 (definition + constitutional anchor)
		  
		  **Ethics in administration refers to adherence to values like impartiality, accountability, and service above self.** Article 14 guarantees equality before law, while Article 21 ensures dignified treatment by the state—both depend on ethical conduct by officials. For instance, the Central Vigilance Commission Act mandates proactive disclosure and swift action against corruption. However, slow prosecutions and political interference dilute deterrence. Therefore, ethics must be embedded in recruitment, training, performance appraisal, and grievance redressal systems.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 2 (cause-effect with scheme example)
		  
		  **Transparency laws like the RTI Act empower citizens to demand accountability and expose misconduct.** Since 2005, over 60 lakh RTI applications annually have uncovered irregularities in ration distribution, land records, and public procurement. Moreover, social audits under MGNREGA involve gram sabhas in reviewing expenditure, reducing leakage by 30% in Rajasthan. Yet, RTI activists face harassment, and 90 have been killed since the Act's passage. Consequently, protect whistleblowers through witness protection schemes and fast-track courts for retaliation cases.
		- ##### Body Paragraph 3 (multi-dimensional + action words)
		  
		  **Professionalize bureaucracy by depoliticizing transfers, linking promotions to outcomes, and mandating ethics training.** Currently, average tenure for district collectors is under one year, preventing long-term planning or accountability. In contrast, fixed tenures with performance-linked incentives—as piloted in Andhra Pradesh's administrative reforms—improve service delivery and reduce corruption perception scores. Thus, institutionalize merit through transparent postings, annual integrity audits, and e-governance to minimize human discretion in routine transactions.
		- ##### Conclusion (solution-focused + dignity phrase)
		  
		  Ethics in administration is the bridge between constitutional promises and lived reality for citizens. Strengthen transparency through enforceable RTI, professionalize cadres with fixed tenures and outcome metrics, and protect whistleblowers to build deterrence. These reforms restore dignity through safe work and secure entitlements, ensuring the state earns trust not through power, but through integrity. A humane-centric model that protects the poorest first will transform governance from a transaction into a covenant.

	- #### Key Observations in These Examples
		- **Introductions** use hooks (story, context, current affairs), state the thesis clearly, and preview the body's roadmap.
		- **Body paragraphs** follow: Introduce → Explain → Example/Data → Contrast → Mini-conclusion in 3–5 sentences.
		- **Connectors** (therefore, however, moreover, thus, consequently) guide transitions and logic.
		- **Pronouns and demonstratives** (this, these, they) maintain flow without repetition.
		- **Tone** is analytical: claims are supported with reasons, evidence, and counterpoints.
		- **Conclusions** synthesize arguments, reframe the thesis, and close with a forward-looking phrase or quote tied to the theme.
